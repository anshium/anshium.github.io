            <p>None of them are with me anymore - just their memories. </p>
            <p>They were strays who came to us but we eventually ended up semi-adopting them. We took care of basic food and comfort, gave them a place at our home whenever they wanted to come but were free to go out and explore whatever they want.</p>
            <p>They were one of the sweetest. The dog <i>Kalu</i> use to accompany us from the bus stop to my home, sit besides me during thunderstorms, protected us from other dogs.</p>
            <p>The cat <i>Cat Billi / Meow Billi</i>was just as sweet. Didn't like me away even for a minute, sometimes used to sleep besides me and meowed when I went away.</p>
